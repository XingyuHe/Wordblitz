## Wordblits

This is a wordblitz style game. My beautiful and lovely girl Amanda is really good at spelling. She even won the middle school spelling bee. She is pretty smart. But is she smarter than the O(N) computer (where N is the number of the charactesr in the grid)

### Features
* We sort the found word by frequency so she won't suspect you of finding uncommon word. This is a achieved by maintaining a priority queue where the key is the frequency of the word
* We can adjust the length of the word found
* Press enter to get the next found word on the grid

### LOVE YOU# Wordblitz
